This file contains the link to three machine learning models that can be downloaded for use in predicting Liquidus temperature, viscosity at Liquidus, and Glass-Forming Ability (GFA).https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ffxaTF3UMpA4sSJwdH56QHmpj84A4gQd?usp=sharingFirst modelrf_tliquidus: Predicts Liquidus TemperatureSecond modelrf_visc_liquidus: Predicts viscosity at LiquidusUsing the first and second models, it is possible to calculate Glass-Forming Ability (GFA) through path 1 using the attached deploy_load code.Third modelrf_gfa: Predicts GFA directly (path 2)Using the third model, it is possible to calculate GFA through path 2 using the attached deploy_load code. The code accepts as input a dictionary of compositions or a DataFrame containing compositions."
